## Lessons Learned
This was our second project of cloning a whole website. And it was such a great experience.
The main Lesson we learned from working on this project is the knowledge gained from the process of conducting a project.
We build this project is just 6 days and as a fresher we think its a great acomplishment. 
first when we saw the website given to us then we all were worried whether we will able to build it or not but we worked as a team and completed the task.
While building  this projects there were lots of new things to learn. For newer concepts in html css and javascript we googled and applied it to our project . We had a great journey and a amazing learning experience while building this project.
